<h1 class="title">My first Chaos Communication Congress, 36c3</h1>
<p class="date">2020-01-04</p>
</header>
<p>The 36th Chaos Communication Congress took place in Leipzig from
26-30 December, 2019. I’d always wanted to be part of the congress, but
it is quite difficult to score a ticket if you’re not part of a
hackerspace. Last year though, I was determined, and managed to get a
ticket to <a
href="https://events.ccc.de/congress/2019/wiki/index.php/Main_Page">36c3</a>
during the second presale.</p>
<p>I was quite excited, but also quite nervous, as I had no idea what to
expect from this mega congress of <em>17000</em> people!</p>
<p>I was pleasantly surprised: I have not seen anything like this
before, and you really need to be there to know what I am talking about.
I do want to log my experience simply because I want to preserve it
somewhere.</p>
<h2 id="be-excellent-to-each-other">Be excellent to each other</h2>
<p>With 17k people, and with the word chaos in the name, and with no
central authority to police people around, you need some guiding
principle that everyone abides by. The simple guideline, <em>Be
excellent to each other</em>, worked really well. Of course there were
some rough edges here and there, and I did hear stories of rude
behaviour from my new friends, but overall, the event went pretty
smoothly.</p>
<h2 id="assemblies">Assemblies</h2>
<p>The large halls in the venue are divided up into blocks, and each
block is transformed by like-minded hackers into assemblies. There were
assemblies for local hacker spaces, for electronics/hardware hacking,
and even a Perl hackers assembly. I learned there that there is a CCC
Z�rich chapter too, and that they’re visiting as part of the Swiss CCC
assembly. So I had to go and say hi to them (Back in Z�rich, I also went
to one <em>Chaostreff</em>, their weekly meeting).</p>
<h2 id="talks-and-workshops-i-found-interesting">Talks and workshops I
found interesting</h2>
<p>The real meat of the conference are the <a
href="https://events.ccc.de/congress/2019/wiki/index.php/Static:Self-organized_Sessions">self-organized
sessions</a>, since you can watch most talks (modulo technical glitches)
<a href="https://media.ccc.de/">online</a>. Nevertheless, I attended a
good mix of workshops and talks, as I wanted to just soak in as much
Congress as I could, without forcing myself into any one kind of
thing.</p>
<h3 id="the-case-for-scale-in-cybersecurity4"><a
href="https://media.ccc.de/v/36c3-11220-the_case_for_scale_in_cyber_security">The
case for scale in cybersecurity</a></h3>
<p>The premise of this talk is that good security today research not
only requires the traditional security related skills, but also
engineering expertise to scale solutions.</p>
<h3 id="large-hadron-collider-infra-talk5"><a
href="https://media.ccc.de/v/36c3-10760-the_large_hadron_collider_infrastructure_talk#t=1655">Large
Hadron Collider infra talk</a></h3>
<p>This one was fascinating. Go watch the talk (and other talks from the
LHC team from previous Congresses). The highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Charged particles are bent along the curvature of the collider
using powerful dipole electromagnets with a flux density of 8.3 Tesla.
This requires about 118500 Amps of current.</p></li>
<li><p>This current is carried using a superconducting strip. The magnet
coils are also superconducting, and operate at 1.7 K (outer space is 2.9
K!).</p></li>
<li><p>Bunches of charged particles are accelerated together. Since
these particles carry the same kind of charge, they repel each other,
and tend to “unbunch”. This is fixed by placing focusing magnets along
the circumference of the tube. Note that this focusing needs to be done
both along and perpendicular to the direction of travel of the
particles.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="what-the-world-can-learn-from-hong-kong6"><a
href="https://media.ccc.de/v/36c3-10933-what_the_world_can_learn_from_hongkong">What
the world can learn from Hong Kong</a></h3>
<p>Hong Kongers have persistently protested against a proposed bill that
will allow extradition to China. In spite of various atrocities
inflicted by the government at the protesters, the protests are alive.
This fascinating talk is an analysis of techniques used in these
protests (and to an extent, also earlier protests).</p>
<p>To me, the idea of “Climbing the same mountain, in different ways”
really hit home. Authoritarian governments try to create division among
protesters by highlighting one particular group’s methods. This causes
groups to oppose each other, often losing sight of the common goal. For
example, during the Indian struggle for independence from British rule,
Gandhi’s non-violent non-cooperation movement was a fundamentally
different approach compared to the more direct, offensive approach taken
by the likes of Bhagat Singh. Both groups had the same high level goal,
but Gandhi’s group was opposed to <em>any</em> form of violence, even if
it was in direct response to British atrocities. Hong Kongers have
figured out how to totally support fellow protesters, even if their
means to the common goal are varied and sometimes opposed.</p>
<p>Another interesting bit was how art and technology is used. Entire
day’s worth of events are condensed into sharp memes and infographics
(also translated into many Western languages) so that everyone in the
world can understand the protesters’ side of the story. This is very
important in face of state held press conferences that constantly
condemn the protesters. Telegram groups are used to dump locations of
police cars, water cannons, tear gas, and other artifacts of interest.
These are picked up and overlaid on a map so citizens can plan both
protests and more ordinary things like trips to airports with ease.</p>
<p>I also could draw parallels to the situation in India where, as I
write this, there are protests against the proposed Citizenship
Amendment Bill. It is striking how similar the government’s response has
been to that of the Hong Kong authorities. But the Indian government is
not shy to exercise drastic measures like Internet shutdowns. This is
not in small part due to the fact that a large fraction of educated
Indians (around me, my sample) seem to not have a problem with the
government interfering at this level, as long as it advertises its
intent as nationalistic.</p>
<h3 id="a-hackers-guide-to-healthcare7"><a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zuq4kiYJKAk">A hacker’s guide to
healthcare</a></h3>
<p>A short, sweet talk about the challenges of healthcare data, with
emphasis on the privacy implications.</p>
<p>Various data protection regulations speak of the distinction between
narrow and broad consents that individuals can give on their health
data. However, on the ground, individuals waiting for emergency
treatment will seldom read the fine print on admission forms, much less
push back on the broad-consent-by-default clauses in there.</p>
<p>Then there are challenges around healthcare data produced by
different organizations. Mixed units, different names for treatments,
etc. are rampant, and hence data must be compiled with care. There is
also confusion around the ground truth – for a given condition, what
diagnosis was “the right one”? Without robust ground truth, it is
difficult to use such data for machine learning purposes.</p>
<p>Speaking of ML, fairness is a tricky issue. Healthcare data is
incomplete and far from representative. Models trained on this data are
going to be biased. It is important then to quantify this bias using an
appropriate definition of “fairness”. For example, one might say that a
fair model has equal false positive rates across groups defined by
sensitive attributes. Another definition of fairness might assert that
protected characteristics have no effect on classification. But then I
ask why include them at all? And even if we identify and remove all
sensitive attributes, can we guarantee that the model won’t learn these
attributes anyway from other attributes? In that sense, can we ever be
confident that we’ve identified all sensitive attribute
combinations?</p>
<h3 id="the-search-for-anonymous-data">The search for anonymous
data</h3>
<p>This talk was unfortunately not recorded, but the premise is that
conventional methods of scrubbing datasets clean of private and
personally identifying information is not sufficient today.</p>
<p>Even techniques like k-anonymity fall short (susceptible to
differential attacks). The speaker proposes a move from released
datasets to a query-response paradigm, where all data is accessed only
via a trusted gateway, which responds only if the query is guaranteed to
not leak private information (within the bounds promised by the system).
For example, there was mention of the <a
href="https://aircloak.com/solutions/how-it-works/">Diffix</a>, which is
a system that works this way.</p>
<h3 id="quantum-computing">Quantum computing</h3>
<p>There was a lot of buzz about quantum computing in the Congress. I
think this is because the CCC attracts security focussed individuals and
professionals, and guess what promises to break RSA crypto one day?</p>
<p>From a guy who is trying to <a
href="https://media.ccc.de/v/36c3-10808-build_you_own_quantum_computer_home_-_99_of_discount_-_hacker_style">build
a quantum computer</a> in his “backyard”, to <a
href="https://media.ccc.de/v/36c3-11039-quantum_computing_are_we_there_yet">an
analysis of the current landscape of the field</a>, to hallroom
discussions around the topic, I found a lot of people taking interest in
the topic. This also prompted me to finally pick up a book to study the
basics of QM as applicable to QC.</p>
<p>Some parties have <a
href="https://www.ibm.com/blogs/research/2019/10/on-quantum-supremacy/">challenged</a>
the recent <a
href="https://ai.googleblog.com/2019/10/quantum-supremacy-using-programmable.html">quantum
supremacy claims</a> from Google. However, the general understanding in
the CCC seemed to be that even if Google’s experiment used an
“artificial” problem, the fact that 53 qubits can be controlled in this
manner is a great validation of the very idea of quantum computing.</p>
