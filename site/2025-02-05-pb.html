<p>The first month of the year has been memorable. We got sick on the
new year’s eve, we think it was COVID. Awful stuff, led to a mild
bronchitis. Then our daughter started going to daycare, which has
resulted in additional sickness updates to the houshold. Not fun, but we
count our blessings: I am off on baby-bonding leave, and ain’t no better
bonding than caring for her through this with 100% empathy.</p>
<p>Because of this sickness, I’ve not been able to lift or run as much
as I’d like to, but there’s some slow progress. I hit new personal bests
on the squat and bench press: 1x120 kg and 1x100 kg respectively. The
latter had been a goal for some time. Next goals: Squat 3x120kg and
bench 3x100. My clean technique had a step improvement after I realized
that the truly explosive part of the movement is ripping <em>under</em>
the bar, not the hip drive that sends the bar up.</p>
<p>Like many Indian expats, I’ve been following US politics closely. One
big insight for me was how a even a popular government can be tossed out
of office if it fucks too much with the powers that run the economy. The
constant threat to regulate up-and-coming tech, an outlook to doing
things “safely” without actually defining what safe means, or without
regard to the market-oriented culture that makes the US a great breeding
ground for successful businesses, did not seem to go well with the
capitalist elite. Even with those who used to vote Democrat. I do think
the Left has a lot to answer for for this failure. It has gone from a
liberal, freedom-oriented culture to groupthink,
no-debating-over-wrong-topics over the last decade or so. It is clear
that AI is going to see an accelerated development across the world.
India, like China, must develop its own moat here.</p>
<p>I have a new interest in philosophy, especially questions around <a
href="https://www.amazon.com/Justice-Whats-Right-Thing-Do/dp/0374532508">morality</a>,
nature of knowledge. Above all, it tends to demand a certain structure
on one’s thinking which is very useful and transfers well to day-to-day
decision making. I’ve also been deeply enjoying <a
href="https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/18-06-linear-algebra-spring-2010/video_galleries/video-lectures/">linear
algebra</a> as a subject in and of itself, even though I’d started to
refresh myself on the topic to understand the math behind transformers
and quantum computing better. I have also used this time off work to get
fluent with tech I don’t get to use at work: Kubernetes, Docker, new age
editor wars (there’s VSCode, Zed and a million AI-assisted
editors/IDEs). Also as I’ve been writing a ton of Go, I like the
language a overall, but I still think some <a
href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10510691/how-to-check-whether-a-file-or-directory-exists">things</a>
are more difficult than necessary.</p>
<p>Also starting late last year, I’ve been working on anger. I’m not a
destructive person, but tend to get mild-to-moderate pissed at the
smallest situations if they are of the Right Shape. Only after my
daughter’s birth did I realize truly that this only takes away from my
enjoyment of the world. So with step one, the acknowledgement of the
problem, out of the way, I’ve made progress in developing my own toolkit
to defer expression of anger, which usually leads to its dissipation. I
don’t know if it works well yet, and so I’m not yet ready to write about
it.</p>
<p>I have decided to give a good shot to dressing well (well, at least
better). I enjoy X threads from <a href="https://dieworkwear.com/"><span
class="citation" data-cites="dieworkwear">@dieworkwear</span></a>, and
decided that I can at least try to put together my next shopping bag
with some more intention.</p>
<p>Well so much so far, looking forward to the rest of the year. It’s
going to be good.</p>
