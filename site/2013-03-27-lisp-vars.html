<h1 class="title">Variables in Common Lisp</h1>
<p class="date">2013-03-27</p>
</header>
<p>Common Lisp is a dynamically, but strongly typed language. The
variables carry the type information that can be fetched at runtime, and
hence, the type errors are detected dynamically. In this way, it is most
similar to Python, which, too, is a dynamically but strongly typed
language.</p>
<p>All values in Common Lisp conceptually are references objects.
Assigning a new value to a variable only makes it refer to the new
object. It does not change the referrent. This is very much like how
Python names and bindings work and unlike C++ references, which
themselves are always const. Of course, if a variable holds a reference
to a mutable object, it is always possible to modify it via the
reference, and the changes will be visible via all other references to
that object.</p>
<p>A binding is the runtime manifestation of a variable. For example,
when a function is called, the variables in the parameter list of the
function definition are bound by Lisp to the objects that are the actual
arguments of that particular call. A single variable can end up having
many different bindings during the run of a program - it can even have
multiple bindings at the same time, e.g., for a function parameter
variable during a recursive function calls.</p>
<h2 id="the-let-special-operator">The LET special operator</h2>
<p>Apart from DEFUN, another way of introducing variables is the LET
special operator. The general form of a LET command is this:</p>
<pre><code>(let (variable*)
  body-form*)</code></pre>
<p>Here, each <code>variable</code> is a variable initialization form,
which is either a list containing a variable name and an initial value
or just a variable name, which gets an initial value of NIL.</p>
<pre><code>(let ((x 10) (y 20) z)
  (list x y z))

;; (10 20 NIL)</code></pre>
<p>That code binds the variables x, y and z to values 10, 20 and NIL,
respectively.</p>
<p>When a LET form is encountered, all the initialization forms are
evaluated first and then new bindings are created for the variables to
the initial values before any of the body forms are executed. Within the
body of LET, the variable names refer to the newly created bindings.
After the LET, the names refer to whatever they were referring to before
the LET. Everytime a LET is entered, the variables are rebound. The
return value of a LET form is the value of the last expression evaluated
in its body.</p>
<h2 id="scope">Scope</h2>
<p>The scope of both LET variables and function parameters is delimited
by the form they were introduced in, which in turn is called the binding
form. Nesting binding forms that introduce variables with the same name
causes the binding of the innermost variable shadows all outer
bindings.</p>
<pre><code>CL-USER&gt; (defun foo (x)
       (format t &quot;Parameter: ~a~%&quot; x)
       (let ((x 2))
         (format t &quot;Outer LET: ~a~%&quot; x)
         (let ((x 3))
           (format t &quot;Inner LET: ~a~%&quot; x))
             (format t &quot;Outer LET: ~a~%&quot; x))
       (format t &quot;Parameter: ~a~%&quot; x))
     
FOO
CL-USER&gt; (foo 4)
Parameter: 4
Outer LET: 2
Inner LET: 3
Outer LET: 2
Parameter: 4
NIL</code></pre>
<p>In general, any construct that introduces a new variable name that is
usable only within that construct is a binding form. For example, the
DOTIMES macro, which is a basic counting loop, introduces a counter
variable that is incremented at every iteration, upto a certain
count.</p>
<pre><code>(dotimes (x 10) (format t &quot;~a &quot; x))
;; 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 </code></pre>
<p>Another binding form, called <code>LET*</code> allows one to use
previously defined variables in the variable list to initialize a
variable. e.g., this is possible:</p>
<pre><code>(let* ((x 10)
       (y (* x x)) ; note that x was used to initialize y.
  (list x y))</code></pre>
<h2 id="lexical-variables-and-closures">Lexical variables and
closures</h2>
<p>Lexical variables in Lisp are like the lexically scoped local
variables of other languages like Python, C++. A lexical variable
binding can be accessed by all code that lies textually within the
binding form of that variable. But there is a twist, when nested
functions come into the play.</p>
<pre><code>(let ((count 0))
    #&#39;(lambda ()
        (setf count (1+ count))))</code></pre>
<p>Here, as we enter the LET, a binding for <code>count</code> gets
created, and the value returned from the LET is a function that accesses
the count binding from its enclosing scope. All fine so far, since the
lambda itself lies textually within the binding form of the count
variable. But, when this lambda is returned to the caller of the LET,
and invoked from there, that code is not textually within the LET. But
as it turns out, this works perfectly fine.</p>
<pre><code>(defparameter *fn* (let ((count 0))
                        #&#39;(lambda ()
                            (setf count (1+ count)))))
(funcall *fn*) ;; 1
(funcall *fn*) ;; 2
(funcall *fn*) ;; 3
...</code></pre>
<p>As we can see, if count is a lexical variable, any bindings created
for it are retained for as long as needed, in this case, for as long as
someone holds a reference to the returned lambda. The inner lambda is a
full closure.</p>
<p>The key point to note is that it is the bindings that are captured in
an inner function, and not just the value, which means that not only can
the inner function access the value of the captured variable, it can
also assign new values to it and they will persist between calls.</p>
<p>A single closure can close over multiple variable bindings by simply
referring to them. Similarly, multiple closures can also capture the
same binding.</p>
<h1 id="common-lisp---dynamic-variables">Common Lisp - Dynamic
variables</h1>
<p>Sometimes global variables are needed to store stuff like standard
I/O stream handles. In lisp, global variables are nicer to manage than
their counterparts in other languages. These variables are called
dynamic variables in Lisp, and as a convention, their names start and
end with a *. There are two ways to define dynamic variables, DEFVAR and
DEFPARAMETER. DEFVAR assigns to the variable only if it is undefined,
while DEFPARAMETER works regardless. Both DEFVAR and DEFPARAMETER take a
variable name, an initial value and an optional documentation string.
One can leave out the initial value in a DEFVAR, which results in an
unbound dynamic variable.</p>
<pre><code>(defvar *count* 0
  &quot;Count of widgets made so far.&quot;)

(defparameter *gap-tolerance* 0.001
  &quot;Tolerance to be allowed in widget gaps.&quot;)</code></pre>
<h2 id="rebinding-dynamic-variables">Rebinding dynamic variables</h2>
<p>Sometimes, we need to be able to change the value of a global
variable just for a part of our code. For example, the
<code>*standard-output*</code> global variable is bound to the standard
output stream. One might want a part of the code calling functions that
write to <code>*standard-output*</code> to actually write to a file
instead of writing it to stdout. We can do this by assigning to
<code>*standard-output*</code> a handle to our file, executing our code
and resetting <code>*standard-output*</code> to stdout. But a neater a
way is provided by Lisp. Whenever a form introduces a variable having
the same name as a dynamic variable, all code within the binding form
and all code called by this code see the new binding. So for example, we
can do this:</p>
<pre><code>(format t &quot;This will be printed to stdout.~%&quot;)

(let ((*standard-output* *some-other-stream*))
  (format t &quot;This will be printed to a file.~%&quot;))

(format t &quot;This will again be printed to stdout.~%&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>What is important to note is that while lexical variable bindings are
seen only by code textually within the binding form of the variables(and
closures, of course), all code CALLED from a binding form of a dynamic
variable also sees the new binding. The binding is restored as soon as
the binding form is done executing.</p>
<p>An example:</p>
<pre><code>CL-USER&gt; (defvar *x* 10)
*X*
CL-USER&gt; (defun foo () (format t &quot;x: ~d~%&quot; *x*))
STYLE-WARNING: redefining COMMON-LISP-USER::FOO in DEFUN
FOO
CL-USER&gt; (foo)
x: 10
NIL
CL-USER&gt; (let ((*x* 100)) (foo))
x: 100
NIL
CL-USER&gt; (foo)
x: 10
NIL</code></pre>
<p>All variables defined using DEFVAR and DEFPARAMETER are declared
globally special. This means that whenever a binding form tries to
create a binding for a variable that has been declared special, a
dynamic binding is created instead of a normal, lexical binding.</p>
<p>These examples I got from folks in #lisp on Freenode made the
difference between lexical bindings and dynamic bindings even clearer to
me:</p>
<pre><code>(defun foo (x)
  (let ((l (lambda () x))
    (x 3))
    (funcall l)))

(foo 1) ;; returns 1

(let ((l lambda () *x*)
  (*x* 3))
  (funcall l)) ;; returns 3</code></pre>
<h2 id="constants">Constants</h2>
<p>Constants can be defined using DEFCONSTANT, which has the same form
as DEFPARAMETER,</p>
<pre><code>(defconstant name initial-value-form [documentation-string])</code></pre>
<p>Constants declared in this way are always global. They can’t be
rebound in any way. The convention while naming a constant is to have
the name start and end with +plus-signs+.</p>
<h2 id="assignment">Assignment</h2>
<p>Since all symbols evaluate to the value of the variable they name,
getting the value of a variable is as easy as referring to it. The
workhorse for assignment in Common Lisp is the SETF macro, which by
virtue of being a macro, can examine its arguments, and hence be a
generic assignment operator. The general form is</p>
<pre><code>(setf place value)</code></pre>
<p>e.g.,</p>
<pre><code>(setf x 10)</code></pre>
<p>assigns the value 10 to the variable x. Assigning a new value to a
binding has no effect on any other bindings of that variable or on the
actual value stored in the binding prior to the assignment. Thus calling
<code>foo</code>:</p>
<pre><code>(defun foo (x)
  (setf x 10))</code></pre>
<p>will not have any effect on any value outside <code>foo</code>.
Concretely, a form like:</p>
<pre><code>(let ((y 20))
  (foo y)
  (print y))</code></pre>
<p>prints 20, not 10.</p>
<p>Multiple assignments can be done with one SETF:</p>
<pre><code>(setf x 1 y 2)</code></pre>
<p>will assign 1 to x and 2 to y. Also, since setf(like assignment
operators in most other languages) returns the assigned value,
assignments can be chained:</p>
<pre><code>(setf x (setf y (random 10)))</code></pre>
<p>will set both x and y to the same random number. Note that this is
similar to <code>x = y = random.randint(0, 10)</code> in Python.</p>
<p>SETF can be used to assign not only to variables, but to any place
that can hold a value. Examples include, an array element, a field slot
of a user-defined object, an entry in a hashtable, etc. This is
intuitive, as the assignment operator <code>=</code> works in exactly
the same way in most other languages - it can be used to assign to
object members, array elements, hashtable entries, regular variables,
etc.</p>
<p>SETFing a place which is a part of a larger object has the same
semantics as regular SETF on a variable - it does not affect the value
that was stored previously in that place. This is just like how
Python/Java do it.</p>
<h2 id="other-ways-to-modify-places">Other ways to modify places</h2>
<p>While SETF is a very general assignment tool that is the go to place
for almost all assignment needs, certain assignment patterns are common
enough to justify the inclusion of their own operators. e.g., the
increment operation, which is used to increment a value by 1, can be
written using SETF as</p>
<pre><code>(setf x (+ x 1))</code></pre>
<p>But increments and decrements are very commonplace and having more
concise ways of performing them makes sense.</p>
<pre><code>(incf x) ;; Equivalent to (setf x (+ x 1))

(decf x) ;; Equivalent to (setf x (- x 1))</code></pre>
<p>INCF and DECF belong to a class of macros called modifier macros.
Modifier macros are built on top of SETF to modify the value at a place.
When the place argument to a modifier macro is an expression that needs
to be evaluated once (which typically is the case when evaluation of the
place form results in some side-effects), modify macros do the right
thing. Generally, they are guaranteed to evaluate both their arguments
and the subforms of the place form exactly once. For example, let us
consider the following INCF:</p>
<pre><code>;; Increment a random element in *array*
(incf (aref *array* (random (length  *array))))</code></pre>
<p>A naive translation to SETF might look like this:</p>
<pre><code>(setf (aref *array* (random (length *array*)))
      (1+ (aref *array* (random (length *array*)))))</code></pre>
<p>But that call to RANDOM is not deterministic, the second AREF might
not give the same element of the array as the first call. A more sane
approach here would be to use a temporary variable to hold the random
number in a LET and then use that in both the AREFs. INCF takes care of
all this.</p>
<p>Two other useful modifier macros are ROTATEF and SHIFTF. ROTATEF
rotates the values between the places it takes as arguments.</p>
<pre><code>(rotatef a b) ;; swap the values in a and b

CL-USER&gt; (let ((a 0) (b 1) (c 2))
           (format t &quot;~a~%&quot; (list a b c))
           (rotatef a b c)
           (format t &quot;~a~%&quot; (list a b c)))
(0 1 2)
(1 2 0)
NIL</code></pre>
<p>SHIFTF shifts the values in the places in its argument list, till the
second last argument, one place to the left. The second last place
itself is given the last argument’s value.</p>
<pre><code>CL-USER&gt; (let ((a 0) (b 1) (c 2))
       (format t &quot;~a~%&quot; (list a b c))
       (shiftf a b c)
       (format t &quot;~a~%&quot; (list a b c)))
(0 1 2)
(1 2 2)
NIL</code></pre>
<p>So here, a gets b’s value, b gets c’s. But c being the last argument,
it is treated as a filler value for the second last argument, b, and is
not itself modified. The value of the first argument is the return value
of SHIFTF.</p>
<p>All in all, variables in Lisp are pretty easy to grok, especially if
one understands how names/bindings work in Python(as was the case with
me). It is fascinating how one of the earliest programming languages
just gets variables right, complete with dynamic typing.</p>
