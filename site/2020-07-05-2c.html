<h1 class="title">Two’s complement arithmetic is magic</h1>
<p class="date">2020-07-05</p>
</header>
<p>Recently I revisited two’s complement arithmetic. It’s one of the
coolest tricks I’ve seen.</p>
<p>Computers internally represent integers (whole numbers like -1, 0,
42) with a a fixed number of bits. Consider a tiny computer that allows
only 3-bit integers. So if we are talking only non-negative integers, 0
could be coded as the bit vector 000, 1 as 001, 2 as 010, … 7 as 111.
This is just one possible coding, probably the most obvious one.</p>
<p>But say we also want to represent negative integers. A simple coding
there could be to treat the most significant (leftmost) bit as the sign
bit, and the remaining two bits for absolute value of the integer being
represented. Here’s a possible mapping:</p>
<pre><code>000 --&gt; +0
001 --&gt; +1
010 --&gt; +2
011 --&gt; +3
100 --&gt; -0
101 --&gt; -1
110 --&gt; -2
111 --&gt; -3</code></pre>
<p>Note two points:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>There are two zeros, which means we waste one combination of bits
(000 and 100 both are technically the number 0; we could have used one
of them for an extra integer, either in the negative or the positive
half)</li>
<li>We need to build circuitry to be aware of negative numbers for
operations like addition (adding a positive and a negative should
produce a sign bit equal to the larger of the two numbers, and should
have the value equal to the bitwise <em>subtractions</em> of the
respective values).</li>
</ol>
<p>Another coding of negative numbers, called the two’s complement
encoding, sidesteps both of these issues. Here’s how the coding
looks:</p>
<pre><code>000 --&gt; +0
001 --&gt; +1
010 --&gt; +2
011 --&gt; +3
100 --&gt; -4
101 --&gt; -3
110 --&gt; -2
111 --&gt; -1</code></pre>
<p>In this approach, the core idea is this: When we <em>add</em> (using
the usual bitwise addition rules) together the bitvector representing an
integer N and its negative -N, the result should be a bit vector 1
followed by as many zeros as our representation’s bit width. So adding
+1 (001) and -1 (111) gives 1000. So does adding +2 (010) and -2 (110).
Technically, these pairs are called two’s complements of each other –
Any two numbers representable with &lt;= <span
class="math inline">\(W\)</span> bits that add up together to give
exactly <span class="math inline">\(2^W\)</span> are two’s complements
of each other. In our example, <span class="math inline">\(W=3\)</span>,
so <span class="math inline">\(2^W = 8\)</span>, which is written 1000
in binary.</p>
<p>One exception here is -4, which does not have its corresponding
positive under this coding. That’s because its two’s complement for a
3-bit representation is itself! (100 + 100 = 1000). In general, in the
2c representation, the negative half is always exactly one element
larger than the positive half, owing to one element in the positive half
being allotted to 0.</p>
<p>Here’s the cool bit: Say we want to subtract a number from itself.
One way to do this is to add the number to its negative. As shown above,
in the two’s complement representation, this operation always produces
1000. That’s 4 bits, but we only have 3 bits. What happens in this case?
The left most bit is simply discarded (it “overflows”), and we are left
with 000, which is 0, which should be the result of subtracting a number
from itself! Now this works no matter what representible numbers we
pick: Consider subtracting 1 from 3. That’s the same as adding -1 and
3:</p>
<pre><code>   111      (-1)
   011      (+3)
   ---------
 1 010
 ^ ^^^------(+2)
 |
 discard</code></pre>
<p>Note that one “feature” of this representation is that incrementing
the highest positive value “wraps” the result to the most negative value
(incrementing 011, which is +3 gives 100, which is -4).</p>
<p>One way to easily compute the two’s complement (for bit width W):</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>First write down the number in binary, with necessary padding on the
left with 0’s to fill all of W bits.</li>
<li>Flip the bits (0s become 1s, 1s become 0s).</li>
<li>Add 1 to the result</li>
</ol>
<p>BTW the result of step (2) above is called the one’s complement of
the original number: When you add a number with its one’s complement,
you get a bitvector of all 1’s, W-bits wide (e.g., one’s complement, for
a 3-bit representation, of 001 is 110, because adding them together
gives 111).</p>
<p>Today’s computers do not have 3 bit integers: an <code>int64</code>
is quite standard, and it stands for 64 bit wide bit-vector, internally
represented exactly as above: The positive half goes from <span
class="math inline">\(0\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(2^{63} -
1\)</span>, and the negative half from <span
class="math inline">\(-2^{63}\)</span> to <span
class="math inline">\(-1\)</span>.</p>
