<p>I thought of this as I was running in the rain today.</p>
<p>I find certain things easy to do that others struggle with. Going out
in the rain to run when I committed to it is one of those.</p>
<p>Then others do effortlessly some other things that I struggle with,
but would like to do. Dancing at a party is one of them.</p>
<p>The idea. Bob comes and registers with things he finds easy to do.
Say he has no problem eating healthy to keep his desired weight, and is
disciplined at consistent studies. But Bob struggles with healthy sleep
habits.</p>
<p>Eva also registers with her strong and weak points.</p>
<p>Bob periodically publishes his achievements, and challenges others to
eat a certain way for a month.</p>
<p>Bob also takes up a challenge posted by Eva, who has been
consistently reading 3 books a month.</p>
<p>Collaborative filtering can help surface challenges one might be
interested in taking, as well as “requests for challenges” that one
might be interested in putting out.</p>
<p>There are good social activity trackers out there: Strava for sport,
Goodreads for reading, Instagram as a catch-all for your vacations and
what not. So I’m not sure if another tracker is something the world
needs, but it seemed good when I was running hard in the rain :)</p>
