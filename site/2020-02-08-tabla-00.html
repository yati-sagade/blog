<p>When I moved to Zürich last year, I was drawn to percussion in
general. I played around with a drum-kit, and I loved it. The
coordination required to keep time and play the right notes takes my
mind somewhere else. I get to focus only on the current moment, because
if I don’t, I’m going to miss the next beat.</p>
<p>I find the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabla">tabla</a>
unlike many other percussive instruments in that:</p>
<ul>
<li>One of the drums (the <em>daāyā</em>) has to be tuned to the tonic
of the scale on which the melody is based and,</li>
<li>The other drum (the <em>baãyā</em>) is also tuned, but its pitch is
manipulated during play using the heel of the player’s hand.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is the second point above that really drew me to the tabla. For
instance, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNMS3O3xDFc">this
<em>jugalbandhi</em> between Hariprasad Chaurasia’s flute and Zakir
Hussain’s tabla</a> where he mimics the flute on the <em>baãyā</em>, or
<a href="https://youtu.be/4HYr8bdoklI?t=45">this piece</a> where the
player uses the bass drum to add a playful and fluid envelope around the
percussive and unpredictable <em>daāyā</em>.</p>
<p>Finding a Tabla teacher in Switzerland was surprisingly easy for me.
I just posted on an internal mailing list at work, asking for a teacher,
and got a contact. We first evaluated whether the instrument really was
for me, and it turns out that I enjoy it a lot. It requires full
concentration from me. I thought this could be an artifact of novelty,
but I am told that this may not be the case, since there is always a way
of stepping up the difficulty of any piece by breaking it down in
different ways, or by accentuating different parts.</p>
<p>For me though the most difficult part so far has been to play a clear
and loud <em>Na</em>. You see, each note that you can play on a tabla
has a name, and together, they form a little language. In the Hindustani
tradition, a tabla player must, in addition to playing them, be able to
<em>say</em> the notes. The next step is then to string together these
notes into phrases, and players must also be able to sing these phrases.
As an example, <a href="https://youtu.be/oHvw3ceVC1M?t=50">check this
piece out</a> where the tabla.</p>
<p>To avoid picking up bad habits, one has to be extremely careful with
the hand positioning. The problem for me is focusing on strength
building in the hand while also making sure the hand is held in the
right way, with the little and ring fingers relaxe, and the middle
finger stretched out, and with the thumb not swaying too far from the
index finger, and with only the tip of the index finger hitting the very
edge of the drum,… you get the idea.</p>
<p>But I now have a nice tabla. My teacher picked it for me, and it is
beautiful.</p>
<p>Here’s a video of a friend (a very good tabla player) and me playing
a basic piece he taught me. Notice how I struggle with my right hand to
keep the ring finger straight, and how I forget to play the bass drum
sometimes (the piece is <em>Dha Dha Thi Ta Dha Dha Tin Na; Ta Ta Thi Ta
Dha Dha Dhin Na</em>):</p>

<p>I will make another video like this next year and play like my friend
(and possibly be able to play faster).</p>
