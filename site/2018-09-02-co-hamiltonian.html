<h2 id="the-hamcycle-problem">The HAMCYCLE problem</h2>
<p>If a graph <span class="math inline">\(G\left(V, E\right)\)</span>
contains a <a
href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/HamiltonianCycle.html">Hamiltonian
cycle</a>, we can pick a subset <span class="math inline">\(E&#39; ⊆
E\)</span> of edges in the graph such that:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>All vertices in <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> appear in the
resulting subgraph and,</li>
<li>Starting at any vertex, we are able to visit each vertex exactly
once, except for the starting vertex, which is also the last vertex in
the cycle.</li>
</ol>
<p>The Hamiltonian cycle problem asks if a graph <span
class="math inline">\(G\)</span> contains a Hamiltonian cycle – i.e., a
cycle on which each vertex appears exactly once, except for the first
(and the last) vertex of the cycle.</p>
<p>The problem is <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NP-completeness">NP-Complete</a>. It
is in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NP_(complexity)">NP</a>
because while no polynomial time algorithm is known to solve it, given a
graph and a “certificate” which consists of a set of vertices claimed to
constitute a Hamiltonian cycle, one can decide in polynomial time if the
certificate is bogus. Additionally, <em>any</em> problem in NP can be
reduced in polynomial time to an instance of the Hamiltonian cycle
problem, hence making it NP-Complete. <a
href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/proof-hamiltonian-path-np-complete/">Here
is such an example reduction</a>, which works on the related Hamiltonian
Path problem, which in turn can be reduced in polynomial time to the
Hamiltonian Cycle problem.</p>
<h2 id="the-formal-language-described-by-hamcycle">The formal language
described by HAMCYCLE</h2>
<p>This problem describes a language <span class="math display">\[L =
\{&lt;G&gt;: \text{G is Hamiltonian}\}\]</span> which is in NP. Here,
the notation <span class="math display">\[&lt;G&gt;\]</span> represents
a suitable binary encoding of the graph G (i.e., a string over <span
class="math display">\[\{0, 1\}^*\]</span>).</p>
<h2 id="co-hamcycle">Co-HAMCYCLE</h2>
<p>Consider the complement of problem: Finding if a graph is
<em>not</em> Hamiltonian. This problem is at least as hard as the
original problem, since if there was a polynomial time algorithm to tell
us whether a given graph G is non-Hamiltonian, we could just use this to
solve the original problem of deciding whether G is Hamiltonian.</p>
<p>This complement is in the co-NP class by definition, and it is an
open problem whether co-NP = NP. Since P ⊆ NP, and P is closed under the
complement, P ⊆ NP ∩ co-NP. And if P = NP, co-NP = NP (but the inverse
does not hold), but if co-NP ≠ NP, then P ≠ NP.</p>
<p><img src="/pconp-1.png"  /></p>
<p>The figure above shows that if NP and co-NP are different, P has to
be different than NP, since it must be a subset of both NP and
co-NP.</p>
<h2 id="what-if-co-np-np">What if co-NP = NP?</h2>
<p>Again, proving that co-NP = NP does not show that P = NP (although it
does address an important standing problem in its own right, and leaves
the possibility open that P = NP).</p>
<p>To show that co-NP = NP, we’d have to show that all problems in co-NP
are verifiable in polynomial time. Let’s see what that means in the
context of the co-HAMCYLE problem.</p>
<p>To provide a certificate for the co-HAMCYCLE problem would require
encoding the <em>impossibility</em> of the set of edges in G to be form
a Hamiltonian graph. In other words, the certificate would have to
provide a badge for a claim that the graph G is not Hamiltonian. An
example certificate would be the enumeration of all possible cycles in
the graph. The verification algorithm would then have to check each
cycle for being non-Hamiltonian, and also check that the set of cycles
in the certificate is exhaustive (because there might be a Hamiltonian
cycle that the certificate simply does not contain).</p>
<p>However, for this certificate to be verified in polynomial time, its
length must be polynomial in the size of the graph, and the check for
exhaustiveness of the certificate also needs to be carried out in
polynomial time. I think this is pretty hard, if not impossible to do. I
don’t know how to prove this of course, but if we prove that there can
exist no certificate of length polynomial in the size of the input
graph, we’d have proven that co-HAMCYCLE is <em>not</em> in NP, i.e., NP
≠ co-NP, and by extension, since P must be contained in NP ∩ co-NP, P ≠
NP.</p>
