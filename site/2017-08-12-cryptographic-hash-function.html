<h1 class="title">Cryptographic hash functions</h1>
<p class="date">2017-08-12</p>
</header>
<p>Hashing is commonly used when we want to reduce a message of an
arbitrary size to a fixed length “digest”, for purposes ranging from
integrity checking of files downloaded from the internet to building
blocks for cryptocurrencies. There are many functions one can use to map
the input message to its hash. The only requirement is that the output
be of a known, fixed size. For example, consider the function</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
H_{mod3}\left(x\right) = x \mod 3
\]</span></p>
<p>which maps an arbitrarily large value <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span> to a value in the set <span
class="math inline">\(\left\\{ 0,1,2 \right\\}\)</span>. Such hash
functions (i.e., based on simple modulo arithmetic) are used (with
other, more complicated hash functions) in distributed systems (see <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistent_hashing">consistent
hashing</a>). However, this simple function has little utility when it
comes to integrity checking. For example, we would like to download a
file and check if the file we downloaded was indeed the one that we
intended to download. This can be solved as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Website offering the file lists the file’s hash along with the
hashing function used.</p></li>
<li><p>We download the file and use the same hashing function on the
contents of the file to get its hash.</p></li>
<li><p>Next, we compare the hash published on the site with the answer
we got, and conclude that the integrity check passed if the hashes are
equal.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>It is easy to see that the simple modulo function based hashing will
not work at all here, since given any message value <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span> (the contents of the file), every third
value, i.e., <span class="math inline">\(x+3, x+6, ...\)</span> will
have the <em>same</em> hash, and an attacker could fool our integrity
checking by adding appropriate content to the original file.</p>
<p>So what do we need from a good hash function for integrity
checking?</p>
<h2 id="collision-freedom">1. Collision freedom</h2>
<p>In the above example, we found <em>collisions</em> under the function
<span class="math inline">\(H_{mod3}\)</span> – i.e., we could easily
craft a message <span class="math inline">\(x&#39;\)</span> such that
<span class="math inline">\(H_{mod3}\left(x\right)
= H_{mod3}\left(x&#39;\right)\)</span> (just pick <span
class="math inline">\(x&#39; = x + 3k\)</span> for any <span
class="math inline">\(k \gt 1\)</span>). We want a hash function <span
class="math inline">\(H\)</span> such that it is extremely hard to find
collisions under it. Note that since a hash function must transform an
arbitrary message into a <em>fixed size</em> output that is often much
smaller than the input size, there will necessarily be collisions – a
large number of them indeed. What is important is that it is extremely
hard to craft a message that does not equal the original message, but
whose hash still matches that of the original message.</p>
<h2 id="hiding">2. Hiding</h2>
<p>It should be extremely hard to figure out the original message <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span> from its hash <span
class="math inline">\(H\left(x\right)\)</span>. Our modulo function
<span class="math inline">\(H_{mod3}\)</span> is actually pretty good at
this — given the remainder of a number of when divided by 3, you cannot
figure out the original number at all, even though you <em>can</em>
reduce the number of candidates by only looking at the numbers that
produce the given remainder when divided by 3. As you might notice, the
degree of hiding offered by the hashing function depends on the range of
values that the message variable <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>
can take up: consider trying to hide the outcome of a coin toss. We’ll
encode <span class="math inline">\(\text{HEAD}=0\)</span>, and <span
class="math inline">\(\text{TAIL}=1\)</span>.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
H_{toss}\left(\text{outcome}\right) = \left(1 + \text{outcome}\right)
\mod 2
\]</span></p>
<p>such that <span
class="math inline">\(H_{toss}\left(\text{HEAD}\right) = 1\)</span> and
<span class="math inline">\(H_{toss}\left(\text{TAIL}\right) =
0\)</span>.</p>
<p>Now if the domain (<span
class="math inline">\(\left\\{\text{HEAD},\text{TAIL}\right\\}\)</span>)
is known to the attacker, given a hash value 1, they might simply try
hashing each value in the set to find out that the original message was
HEAD. The problem here is that the message domain is easily enumerable.
Now if we pick a random integer of, say 256 bits, <span
class="math inline">\(r\)</span> from a distribution with a high <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Min_entropy">min entropy</a>, and
use its bits appended to the original message’s bits, we suddenly have
an input space which is extremely hard to enumerate (<span
class="math inline">\(2^257\)</span> possibilities). So, now, given a
hash value of 1, it is extremely hard for an attacker without the
knowledge of the random key <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> to
deduce the outcome of the toss. Min entropy of a distribution is simply
the negative logarithm of the probability of the <em>most probable</em>
value being taken up by the random variable distributed according to
that distribution. For example, if you have a loaded die that shows a 6
50% of the times, with the other faces each having a probability of 10%,
the min entropy of this distribution would be <span
class="math inline">\(-\lg{\frac{1}{2}} = 1\)</span>, since the most
probable value, 6, comes up with a probability $$. Intuitively, when all
values in a distribution are negligibly likely, and no particular value
is more likely than others, the distribution has a high min entropy, and
it is increasingly difficult to enumerate such a distribution’s values
to break the hiding property of a hash function.</p>
<h2 id="puzzle-friendliness">3 “Puzzle friendliness”</h2>
<p>For the sake of using hashes as challenges, as is done in
cryptocurrency implementations, we need an additional property from a
good hash function. Given a key <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>
chosen from a distribution with high min entropy, and a set of target
hash values <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>, it should be hard to
find a value <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> such that the
concatenation of <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span> hashes to a value in <span
class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>. More precisely, by “hard” we mean that
no strategy of picking <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> values
should be better than randomly picking <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span> values and trying if <span
class="math inline">\(H\(k|x\) \in Y\)</span>.</p>
