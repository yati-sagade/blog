I listened to a recent [Huberman Lab podcast episode with Dr. Ellen Langer][1].
It is a delightful episode, Dr. Langer has a refreshing take on life.

A few things have just stuck with me, and the more I think about them in the
context of my day-to-day life, the more they make sense.

### Behaviors make sense

We all are reminded every now and then of of behaviors that we wish we hadn't
engaged in. Every time, our response varies, maybe we'll resolve to not repeat,
or maybe we'll distract ourselves out of shame. Only sometimes though do we
think deeply of the behavior in the context of the circumstances at the time. I
think we just forget the nuances: Maybe we were underslept, maybe something
else was occupying our mind. Most of the time, _we did X at time T because
doing X made sense at the time!_. Not to shy away from accountability and true
improvement, I find that forgetting to include circumstances in any such
evaluation of past behaviors results either in over-harsh and unhelpful
self-sabotage, or no action at all.

This principle is even more powerful when applied to other people around us.
Their behavior also makes sense to them at the time!
