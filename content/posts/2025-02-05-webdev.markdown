These are my thoughts on learning modern front-end development for the Web.

The context is a simple web application that consumes a RESTful API. Nothing
complicated, simple CRUD on a hierarchy of types (e.g.,
`team<-[belongs_to:1]-user-[owns:*]->folder-[contains:*]->document`).

The same API is also used by a CLI frontend, so authentication is done with
JWTs.
