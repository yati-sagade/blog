title: Tracking and sharing Hard Things

I thought of this as I was running in the rain today.

I find certain things easy to do that others struggle with. Going out in the
rain to run when I committed to it is one of those.

Then others do effortlessly some other things that I struggle with, but would
like to do. Dancing at a party is one of them.

The idea. Bob comes and registers with things he finds easy to do. Say he has
no problem eating healthy to keep his desired weight, and is disciplined at
consistent studies. But Bob struggles with healthy sleep habits.

Eva also registers with her strong and weak points.

Bob periodically publishes his achievements, and challenges others to eat a
certain way for a month.

Bob also takes up a challenge posted by Eva, who has been consistently reading
3 books a month.

Collaborative filtering can help surface challenges one might be interested in
taking, as well as "requests for challenges" that one might be interested in
putting out.

There are good social activity trackers out there: Strava for sport, Goodreads
for reading, Instagram as a catch-all for your vacations and what not. So I'm
not sure if another tracker is something the world needs, but it seemed good
when I was running hard in the rain :)
